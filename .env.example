# ─── NORTHERN Chat Frontend — Local Dev Config ────────────────────────────────────
#
# Copy this to .env.local (never commit .env.local)
#
# RECOMMENDED: proxy mode — Vite forwards /api/* to the NORTHERN backend.
# No backend CORS changes needed. Works out of the box.
VITE_NORTHERN_API_BASE=/api

# Runtime profile:
# - local: full chat/login/signup flows (expects local NORTHERN backend)
# - public_launcher: website /chat becomes launcher-only (no full chat API loop)
# Note: production/public hosts are forced to launcher mode for safety even if set to "local".
VITE_NORTHERN_RUNTIME_PROFILE=local

# Optional launcher target for public_launcher profile
# VITE_NORTHERN_LOCAL_PORTAL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173/chat

# ALTERNATIVE: direct backend mode.
# Requires the NORTHERN backend CORS allowlist to include http://localhost:5173.
# Only use this if you need to bypass the Vite proxy (e.g. testing CORS itself).
# VITE_NORTHERN_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8000

# NORTHERN backend location for the Vite proxy (dev only — server-side, never in bundle)
# The proxy rewrites /api/* → NORTHERN_BACKEND_URL/*
VITE_NORTHERN_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000

# Operator token for privileged API calls (dev only — injected by Vite proxy, never in browser bundle)
# Required for PATCH /chat/profiles/{actor} in PersonalityOnboarding.
# In production: inject server-side via a BFF/reverse proxy. NEVER hardcode.
VITE_NORTHERN_OPERATOR_TOKEN=

# Social OAuth login buttons on Login page (default true unless explicitly "false")
# VITE_NORTHERN_OAUTH_GOOGLE=true
# VITE_NORTHERN_OAUTH_APPLE=true
